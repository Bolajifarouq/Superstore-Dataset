Superstore Sales Dashboard

Iâ€™m excited to showcase my Power BI dashboard, designed to extract actionable insights from the Superstore dataset. 
This project explores key business questions such as:

Top Performers: Which product sub-categories drive the highest sales, and how significant is their contribution to overall revenue?

Shipping Efficiency: How does profitability vary across different shipping modes, and which mode provides the best value?

Discount-Profit Dynamics: What impact do discounts have on profitability across sub-categories, and which products maintain strong profit margins despite markdowns?

Sales and Profit Trends: What monthly trends in sales and profits can we observe, and how can this data guide strategic planning during peak and off-peak periods?
